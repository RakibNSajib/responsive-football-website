                <p>Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo has done it again. Despite seeing his team knocked out in the Round of
                    16, he managed to win the award for top scorer at Euro 2021 with five goals and one assist. It's
                    that lone assist that gives him the tiebreaker over Czech Republic forward Patrik Schick.</p>
